     Welcome to =lisp-lang.org=, the new home of Common Lisp on the
     web.  Previously, if someone wanted to learn Common Lisp, the
     language, their best bet was Peter Seibel’s [[http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/][Practical Common
     Lisp]]. But the book, written in 2005, doesn’t cover setting up a
     modern Common Lisp environment: tools like [[https://www.quicklisp.org/beta/][Quicklisp]] and
     [[http://quickdocs.org/][Quickdocs]] are more recent inventions.

     The Common Lisp HyperSpec™ is the acclaimed online version of the
     ANSI Common Lisp Standard.  The HyperSpec is derived from the
     official standard [fn:official-standard] with permission from
     ANSI and NCITS (previously known as X3). It contains the full
     text of the ANSI standard and ancillary information.

     INCITS 226-1994[S2008]
     Promotes the portability of Common Lisp programs among a variety
     of data processing systems. It is a language specification aimed
     at an audience of implementors and knowledgeable programmers. It
     is neither a tutorial nor an implementation guide.

** Common Lisp Implementations

*** Armed Bear Common Lisp

    [[https://common-lisp.net/project/armedbear/][Armed Bear Common Lisp (ABCL)]]

    ABCL is a full implementation of the Common Lisp language
    featuring both an interpreter and a compiler, running in the
    JVM. Originally started to be a scripting language for the J
    editor, it now supports JSR-223 (Java scripting API): it can be a
    scripting engine in any Java application. Additionally, it can be
    used to implement (parts of) the application using Java to Lisp
    integration APIs.

**** FAQ

     [[https://common-lisp.net/project/armedbear/faq.shtml][Frequently Asked Questions]]

*** Steel Bank Common Lisp

    [[https://common-lisp.net/project/armedbear/][Steel Bank Common Lisp (SBCL)]]

    SBCL is a high performance Common Lisp compiler. It is open source
    free software, with a permissive license. In addition to the
    compiler and runtime system for ANSI Common Lisp, it provides an
    interactive environment including a debugger, a statistical
    profiler, a code coverage tool, and many other extensions. SBCL
    runs on a number of POSIX platforms, and experimentally on
    Windows.

*** Clozure Common Lisp

    [[https://ccl.clozure.com/][Clozure Common Lisp (CCL)]]

    CCL s a free Common Lisp implementation with a long history. Some
    distinguishing features of the implementation include fast
    compilation speed, native threads, a precise, generational,
    compacting garbage collector, and a convenient foreign-function
    interface.

*** Embeddable Common Lisp

    [[https://common-lisp.net/project/ecl/main.html][Embeddable Common Lisp (ECL)]]

    ECL is an interpreter of the Common-Lisp language as described in
    the X3J13 Ansi specification, featuring CLOS (Common-Lisp Object
    System), conditions, loops, etc, plus a translator to C, which can
    produce standalone executables.

    ECL supports the operating systems Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD,
    OpenBSD, OS X, Solaris and Windows, running on top of the Intel,
    Sparc, Alpha, PowerPC and ARM processors.

*** Clasp

    [[https://github.com/clasp-developers/clasp][Clasp]]

    Clasp is a new Common Lisp implementation that seamlessly
    interoperates with C++ libraries and programs using LLVM for
    compilation to native code. This allows Clasp to take advantage of
    a vast array of preexisting libraries and programs, such as out of
    the scientific computing ecosystem. Embedding them in a Common
    Lisp environment allows you to make use of rapid prototyping,
    incremental development, and other capabilities that make it a
    powerful language.

*** CLISP

    [[https://clisp.sourceforge.io/][CLISP]]

    GNU CLISP is a Common Lisp implementation by Bruno Haible, then of
    Karlsruhe University, and Michael Stoll, then of Munich
    University, both in Germany. It implements the language described
    in the ANSI Common Lisp standard with many extensions.
